      <h2>Article Selection Process</h2>
      <p>
        Sources for this project were selected based on scholarly credibility, institutional authority, and direct relevance
        to the research question. Major reference works and public history institutions—including the U.S. Holocaust Memorial
        Museum, the National Archives, Densho, and Encyclopaedia Britannica—were prioritized because they draw on archival
        evidence, peer-reviewed scholarship, and long-standing historical research.
      </p>
      <p>
        These sources were chosen to ensure factual accuracy, represent mainstream academic interpretations, and reflect
        ongoing debates surrounding historical memory and accountability.

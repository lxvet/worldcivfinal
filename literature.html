        What each event was, key similarities, key differences, and where scholars disagree.

        <h2>What each event was</h2>

        <h3>Armenian Genocide (1915–1916; broader WWI-era violence)</h3>
        <p>
          The Armenian Genocide refers to the Ottoman Empire’s campaign of deportation and mass killing of Armenians during World War I.
          Armenians were forcibly removed from their homes, subjected to death marches, and systematically killed, resulting in the deaths
          of hundreds of thousands to over a million people.
        </p>

        <h3>Japanese American Incarceration (1942–1945)</h3>
        <p>
          Japanese American incarceration involved the forced removal and confinement of approximately 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry—two-thirds
          of whom were U.S. citizens—following Executive Order 9066. The U.S. government justified this policy as a matter of military necessity after Pearl Harbor.

      <aside class="card">
        <h2>Key similarities</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>State-driven actions during wartime:</strong> both used national security reasoning</li>
          <li><strong>Targeting based on identity:</strong> ethnic/religious minority vs ancestry (including citizens)</li>
          <li><strong>Mass displacement and loss of rights:</strong> deportations/marches vs removal + incarceration</li>
          <li><strong>Long-term community impact:</strong> trauma, economic loss, stigma, memory politics</li>
        </ul>

    <section class="card" style="margin-top:16px">
      <h2>Key differences emphasized in the literature</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Intent and outcome:</strong> mass killing campaign vs mass incarceration (not extermination)</li>
        <li><strong>Scale and lethality:</strong> enormous death toll vs imprisonment of ~120,000 people</li>
        <li><strong>Geography/conditions:</strong> forced marches across harsh terrain vs guarded camps inside the U.S.</li>
        <li><strong>Recognition and framing:</strong> Armenian Genocide remains politically contested; internment widely acknowledged as unjust with later apology/reparations</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card" style="margin-top:16px">
      <h2>Scholarly disputes and interpretations</h2>
      <p>
        The literature shows different levels of disagreement surrounding these events. Most historians and international institutions recognize the
        Armenian Genocide as genocide, yet the Turkish government and some affiliated scholars dispute the classification and frame the deaths as unintended wartime casualties.
      </p>
      <p>
        In contrast, there is broad scholarly consensus that Japanese American incarceration was unjust and racially motivated, even though wartime narratives
        initially defended it as necessary for security. This difference shows how nationalism, political power, and state interests shape public memory.

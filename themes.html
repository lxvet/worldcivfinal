        These themes connect the scholarly literature to course readings and lectures.

      <h2>Fear and state power</h2>
      <p>
        Both cases show how wartime fear expands government authority and can suspend normal legal protections.
        “Security” reasoning becomes a tool that can override rights—especially for minority groups labeled as threats.
      </p>

      <h2>Dehumanization and racialization</h2>
      <p>
        Armenians were portrayed as traitors to the Ottoman state, while Japanese Americans were racialized as inherently disloyal.
        Once a group is framed as dangerous by identity, repression becomes easier to justify to the public.
      </p>

      <h2>Memory, accountability, and justice</h2>
      <p>
        The contested recognition of the Armenian Genocide contrasts with the eventual acknowledgment and redress of Japanese American incarceration.
        This demonstrates how accountability is unevenly applied and often shaped by politics rather than harm alone.

        Optional enhancement: Insert 1–2 short quotes from course readings (with citations) under each theme to strengthen the course connection.

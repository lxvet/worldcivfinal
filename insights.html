      <h2>Summary of insights</h2>
      <p>
        This comparison shows that wartime repression exists on a spectrum shaped by ideology, intent, and political power.
        While both cases used similar “security” rhetoric, their outcomes differed dramatically, demonstrating the importance of examining state intent and structural violence.
      </p>

      <h2>How this connects to social justice</h2>
      <p>
        Social justice is about rights, protection from discrimination, and accountability when harm is done. Both cases show that minority communities can become
        targets of state power during crisis—leading to long-term trauma, lost property and opportunity, and struggles over recognition. A social-justice lens asks:
        Who is protected by the state, who is made vulnerable, and how (or whether) justice is pursued afterward?
      </p>

      <h2>Personal / group insights</h2>
      <p>
        As a group, we were struck by how easily fear can override civil rights and how long it can take for injustice to be acknowledged.
        This project reinforced the importance of questioning government narratives during times of crisis and recognizing the lasting consequences of state-sanctioned discrimination.
